## Gameplay

- **Controls:**
  - Use the arrow keys "up key" to move the turtle across the road.

- **Objective:**
  - Safely guide the turtle across the road without getting hit by any cars.
  - Successfully cross the road to advance to the next level.

## Features

- Responsive controls using the keyboard arrow keys.
- Randomly moving cars to increase the difficulty.
- Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple files, each handling a specific aspect of the game:

- `main.py`: The main game loop and initialization.
- `car_manager.py`: Handles the movement and behavior of the cars.
- `player.py`: Manages the player's movement and interactions (turtle).
- `scoreboard.py`: Manages the scoring system and displays the score.

## Dependencies

- The game uses the `turtle` module for graphics.
- Ensure you have this module available. `turtle` is included with Python's standard library, so no additional installation is necessary.
